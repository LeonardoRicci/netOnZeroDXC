	*** Software updated to sub-version 1.1.1 (manual is unchanged), mostly to correct data reading issues concerning NaN data.

	* BUGFIX: Data files containing NaNs were previously read by skipping any NaN value as well as any successive column. Files are now read fully, including NaNs.
	* Input data can now contain NaNs. Input sequences, diagrams or efficiency functions that contain at least one NaN value will yield output data filled by NaNs. As an example, if the input sequence of node 023 contains at least one NaN value, all correlation diagrams, p-value diagrams and efficiency functions involving node 023 are filled with NaNs. Consequently, matrices of time scale will report "NaN" in all entries involving node 023.
	* These changes apply to all four executables. As far as the matrix merging app is concerned, NaN values are considered as if the corresponding time scale does not exist (i.e. they are equivalent to -1 for the purposes of the merging process).

	* MINOR: When loading multiple recordings from a single data file, the assigment of labels to nodes is generated by using integer numbers. Previously, the label generation introduced a single leading zero for the nodes 1..9, and no leading zeros for the subsequent nodes. The app netOnZeroDXC_analysis now adds TWO leading zeros to the nodes 1..9 and one leading zero to the nodes 10..99 during label generation, so that nodes will be labelled as 001...009, 010...099...999.

	* MINOR: Few lines of code were changed to improve code clarity.
